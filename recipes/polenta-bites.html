            <li>1/3 cup raisins</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dry red wine (such as Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>        
            <li>1 (16 ounce) tube refrigerated cooked polenta</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>           
            <li>1 (4-ounce) package goat cheese (ch√®vre), crumbled</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a rimmed baking sheet in oven. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring tomatoes, raisins, and red wine to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low; simmer mixture, uncovered, until raisins are plump and most of liquid has evaporated, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in honey, vinegar, thyme, and salt.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, slice polenta into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Gently toss polenta with oil in a large bowl. Remove baking sheet from oven. Arrange rounds in an even layer on baking sheet. </li>
            <li>Bake polenta rounds in the preheated oven, turning halfway through, until lightly golden and crisp on both sides, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>To serve, top polenta rounds with goat cheese and tomato mixture. Garnish with thyme. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
